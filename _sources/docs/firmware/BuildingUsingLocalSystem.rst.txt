Building using your local system
################################

.. note::

    Getting your system to the required state to build firmware is cumbersome.
    It is recommend to check out the alternative of using :ref:`Docker <firmware-building-docker>`  or use a :ref:`CI Runner <firmware-building-github-actions>` .

Prepare your system
*******************

.. note::

    You can always check out the `GitHub Actions workflow <https://github.com/bifravst/firmware/blob/saga/.github/workflows/build-and-release.yaml>`_ as a reference, which sets up a blank Ubuntu image to build the firmware.

Follow the `Getting Started Guide <http://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/getting_started.html>`_ of the Nordic Connect SDK to set up your system for building the project.
Especially make sure to follow the instructions on _Installing the *nRF Connect SDK*.

Clone the project and install dependencies
******************************************

Create a folder, e.g. ``ncs`` and init the project:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ./ncs
    sudo pip3 install -U --pre west
    west init -m https://github.com/bifravst/firmware --mr saga
    west update
    sudo pip3 install -r zephyr/scripts/requirements.txt
    sudo pip3 install pc_ble_driver_py
    sudo pip3 install -r nrf/scripts/requirements.txt
    sudo pip3 install -r mcuboot/scripts/requirements.txt
    # this sets $ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT and $GNUARMEMB_TOOLCHAIN_PATH
    source zephyr/zephyr-env.sh

Building
********

Then build the actual application: change to the ``./ncs/firmware`` directory and build for your board:

Thingy:91 (``PCA20035``)
========================

.. code-block:: bash

    west build -p always -b thingy91_nrf9160ns

nRF9160 DK (``PCA10090``)
=========================

.. code-block:: bash

    west build -p always -b nrf9160_pca10090ns

Location of the HEX file
************************

The built HEX file will be located in ``ncs/firmware/build/zephyr/merged.hex``.
