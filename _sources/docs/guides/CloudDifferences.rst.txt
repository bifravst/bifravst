Cloud Differences
#################

This document records key differences between the reference AWS implementation and other Cloud Providers IoT implementation:

Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
***************************

Authentication
==============

Devices connect to the broker host using TLS 1.2, but authenticate against MQTT using a username (any) and a JWT token, which has been signed with the device key.
Which means devices need to be provisioned `with the TLS Root Certitifcates <https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/mqtt-bridge#using_a_long-term_mqtt_domain>`_ AND the device-specific keypair.

Digital Twin
============

GCP has Configuration (*AWS: desired*) and State (*AWS: reported*).

Devices receive their configuration by subscribing to the ``/devices/${deviceId}/config`` topic.
On successfull subscription they will receive their configuration on this topic.
If the configuration is changed, the updated config will be published to the topic.
There is no *delta*.

Devices publish their state to ``/devices/${deviceId}/state`` topic.
They always must publish the *entire state*, there is no native support for partial update

Websockets
==========

The IoT Core does not support Websocket connections which is used in the app to get notified in real-time about changes on device state.

Microsoft Azure
***************

Device Provisioning Service
===========================

Azure also supports Just-in-Time-Provisioning, but this process is not transparent to the device.
