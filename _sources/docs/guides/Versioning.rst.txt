Versioning
##########

We use `semantic-release <https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release>`_ to automatically determine the next version of a project **and** publish a release in the GitHub project as well as release it to our `npm organization <https://www.npmjs.com/settings/bifravst/packages>`_.

The next version is determined by scanning the commit messages.
They must follow `the Angular commit message rules <https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#commit-message-format>`_, and in every library `a hook <https://github.com/marionebl/commitlint>`_ will check commit messages against these rules.

.. note::

    The ``package.json`` of a project should only contain ``0.0.0-development`` as  the ``version`` property, semantic-release will ignore the value.
    
.. warning::

    Only the published package on npm will contain the correct version number.

How to release a new version of a package
*****************************************

Let's assume we have a library, which has the npm version ``2.3.4``.

A new version will be publish by the respective project's CI run.
All you have to do, is use commit messages that follow the `schema describe here <https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#commit-message-format>`_.

There are three commit messages that will trigger a release:

Patch release:

.. code-block::

    fix: <commit message>

Feature release:

.. code-block::

    feat: <commit message>

Breaking Release:

.. code-block::

    <scope>: <commit message>
    
    BREAKING CHANGE:
    
    <description of breaking change>

.. warning::

    Note that **any other** commit message format **will not trigger** a release.

Patch release (``fix``) ``2.3.4 -> 2.3.5`` üêû
=============================================

.. note::

    A fix is a change to the implementation which removes a bug **without changing the public API** (method names and signatures, exports) of the library.
    The consumer of the library must not need to change their implementation when installing the fixed version.

To release a fix (which will update the version from ``2.3.4`` to ``2.3.5``, use the type ``fix`` in the commit message:

.. code-block::

    fix: <commit message>

You can optionally add a scope, which is a lowercase string used to identify the affected *component*.

.. code-block::

    fix(<scope>): <commit message>

Scopes are useful when the project is rather big.

Feature release (``feat``) ``2.3.4 -> 2.4.0`` üöÄ
================================================

.. note::

    A feature is a change to the implementation of a library which adds additional functionality **without changing the public API** of the library.
    You may add new exports, methods and even extra, optional method arguments, but the consumer of the library must not need to change their implementation when installing the library with the new feature.

To release a feature (which will update the version from ``2.3.4`` to ``2.4.0``, use the type ``feat`` in the commit message:

.. code-block::

    feat: <commit message>

You can optionally add a scope as well.

Breaking Release (``BREAKING CHANGE:``) ``2.3.4 -> 3.0.0`` üö®
=============================================================

.. note::

    Every time the public API of the library changes in a way that requires the consumer to update their implementation **you must mark the change as breaking**. 
    This can happen if method names and arguments are renamed, previously optional arguments become required, arguments get removed, classes get renamed.
    Even if the change is very small, as soon as you are breaking the library's *contract* (its public API) it is considered a breaking change, `according to semver <https://semver.org/#spec-item-8>`_.

To release a breaking release (which will update the version from ``2.3.4`` to ``3.0.0``, use the text :code:`BREAKING CHANGE:` (followed by a space of two new-lines) in the commit message:

.. code-block::

    refactor: <commit message>
    
    BREAKING CHANGE:
    
    <description of breaking change>

You can optionally add a scope as well.

Not that in the case of a breaking release the message type (here ``refactor``) can be any valid type.

Typical changes
***************

Updated dependencies
====================

If you are manually updating dependencies in a library, you should commit the change as a fix, so that consumers are also using the updated dependencies.

Refactoring
===========

If you do a pure refactoring of a library without changing the features and the public API **but** want to use the refactored version in your consumers, commit the refactoring as a feature.
After all, you are improving the library which qualifies as a feature, e.g. it could be a performance-improvement.

How releases are published
**************************

After you have pushed your changes to the remote repository, a job will be run on the CI runner.
If the job completes successfully (e.g. if all tests pass and the linter does not report any errors), ``semantic-release`` will determine the next version to be released.

The *"highest"* commit will *win* (``fix`` > ``feat`` > ``breaking change``).
This means if the list of commit messages since the last release contains *only* fixes, the patch version will be incremented (:code:`2.3.4 -> 2.3.5`).
If the list of commits contains at least one new feature, then the minor version will be incremented and the patch version will be set to ``0`` (``2.3.4 -> 2.4.0``).
If the list of commits contains at least one breaking change, then the major version will be incremented and the minor and patch versions will be set to ``0`` (``2.3.4 -> 3.0.0``).
