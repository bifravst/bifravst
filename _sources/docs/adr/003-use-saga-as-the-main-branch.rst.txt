3. Use ``saga`` as the name for the main branch
###############################################

Historically, Git and other software use terms such as ``master/slave``, ``whitelist/blacklist`` which are based on racial concepts.
Their continued use maintains the racial stereo-types they depict.
Better alternatives in meaning and technical correctness exist, like ``leader/follower``, ``blocklist/allowlist``.

In the Nordic mythology, a *saga* is a long continuous recollection of histories of stories about the history of humans, legends and gods. This idea reflects very well what happens in a Git repository.
Changes happen in branches (some teams tie them to *User Stories*, which are sometimes directly, sometimes loosely coupled to the main branch.
Once they are finished they get added to the main branch, or get appended in case of a rebase.
The mental model of a big book of stories fits this process very well.

Therefore the main branch in this project is named ``saga``. ``master`` shall not be used.
