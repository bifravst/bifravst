   nRF9160 Modem firmware 1.2.0 release notes content

*Bifravst* sets up an IoT rule, which only publishes the ``cfg`` section of the `shadow document <../firmware/state.reported.aws.json>`_ to a separate topic ``$aws/things/<thing name>/shadow/get/accepted/desired/cfg`` when devices receive their state after publishing an empty message to `\$aws/things/<thing name>/shadow/get <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/device-shadow-mqtt.html#get-pub-sub-topic>`_.

The published object might be empty as shown, if the device has no shadow or if the configuration is not set:

.. code-block:: json

    {}

Otherwise, the message will contain one top-level key ``cfg`` and the desired device configuration as shown:

.. literalinclude:: ./desired-cfg.json
  :language: JSON
