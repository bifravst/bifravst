2. Use NPM registry
###################

In March 2020, `GitHub acquired NPM <https://github.blog/2020-03-16-npm-is-joining-github/>`_ and will keep it operational as a registry for public JavaScript packages, so as of now packages can be moved back to NPM.

This supersedes `ADR 001: Use GitHub package registry <https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/asset-tracker-cloud-docs/blob/d14e0e0ec692bea5e3b1ea0b50b359c0dc8c0c4f/docs/adr/001-use-github-package-registry.md>`_.
