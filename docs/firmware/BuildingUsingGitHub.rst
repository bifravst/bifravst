Building using GitHub actions
#############################

Since it is a tedious effort to build the application, you can leverage GitHub Actions (which is free for open-source projects) to build the application for you.
Using the `provided workflow <https://github.com/bifravst/firmware/blob/saga/.github/workflows/build-and-release.yaml>`_ you can quickly set up building for your application using a fork.

After you have forked the repository, `enable GitHub Actions <https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/about-github-actions#requesting-to-join-the-limited-public-beta-for-github-actions>`_ and look for the *Actions* tab in your repo, there you will find the the Action runs.

Go to your repo's settings and configure a new Secret called ``BROKER_HOSTNAME``. Put the hostname of your AWS IoT Core MQTT broker in there.
You can retrieve it using this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Data-ATS

Now commit a change to your repo, e.g. change the MQTT hostname, and the
Action will build the application and attach the HEX files to a release.
