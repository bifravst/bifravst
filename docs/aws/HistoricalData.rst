Storage of historical data
##########################

Bifravst uses `AWS Timestream <https://aws.amazon.com/timestream/>`_ to analyze historical data.
This offers developers a serverless, schema-less data storage optimized for IoT with the capability of querying using SQL.

It provides a great combination of ease of maintenance, flexibility to change device messages, and cost-per-use pricing.
