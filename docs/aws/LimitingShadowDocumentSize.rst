Limiting the Shadow Document Size
================================================================================

The nRF9160 has a size limit of 2303 bytes for receiving TLS packages:

.. code-block::

    *** Limitations
    *************** 
    - TLS/DTLS 
      - 2kB secure socket buffer size.

Source: :code:`mfw_nrf9160_1.2.0_release_notes.txt` from
`1.2.0 nRF91 firmware
binaries <https://www.nordicsemi.com/-/media/Software-and-other-downloads/Dev-Kits/nRF9160-DK/nRF9160-modem-FW/mfwnrf9160120.zip>`_.

Bifravst sets up an IoT rule which only publishes the :code:`cfg`
section of `the shadow document <../firmware/state.json>`_ to a separate
topic :code:`$aws/things/<thing name>/shadow/get/accepted/desired/cfg`
when devices receive their state after publishing an empty message to
`\$aws/things/<thing name>/shadow/get <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/device-shadow-mqtt.html#get-pub-sub-topic>`_.

The published object may be empty if the device has no shadow or the
configuration is not set:

.. code-block:: json

    {}

Otherwise the message will contain one top-level key :code:`cfg`
and the desired device configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ./desired-cfg.json
  :language: JSON
