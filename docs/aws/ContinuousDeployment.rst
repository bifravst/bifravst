Continuous deployment
#####################

You can enable continuous deployment of the changes in your source repository to an AWS account.

.. note::

   It is optional to keep the deployment in your account automatically synchronized with the source code repository.

For the continuous deployment to work, you need to fork the source code in order to register the webhook listener that triggers an upgrade of your deployment.

After forking, make sure to update the ``repository.url`` in the :file:`package.json` file in your fork.

This sets up an AWS CodePipeline, which triggers a CodeBuild project for every push to the :file:`saga` branch.
You can configure the branch in the ``deploy.branch`` property of the :file:`package.json` file.
The CodeBuild project upgrades the CloudFormation stack, which contains the *Bifravst* resources.

A second CodePipeline will be set up for the web application, which triggers a CodeBuild project for every push to the :file:`saga` branch.
You can configure the repository URL and the branch for the web app in the ``deploy.webApp`` property of the :file:`package.json` file.
The CodeBuild project upgrades the web application deployment on the S3 bucket.

Provide GitHub credentials
**************************

You need to create a `developer token <https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line>`_ with ``repo`` and ``admin:repo_hook`` permissions for an account that has write permissions to your repository.

.. note::

   It is recommended to use a separate GitHub account instead of your personal GitHub account.

You need to store this token in `AWS ParameterStore <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html>`_ and it is a manual *one-time* step done through AWS CLI  by using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    aws ssm put-parameter --name /codebuild/github-token \
        --type String --value "<Github Token>"

Enable continuous deployment
****************************

After providing the GitHub credentials, you can set up the continuous deployment by enabling it through the context switch ``cd``:

.. code-block:: bash

    echo "cd=1" >> context.cfg
    npx cdk deploy '*'

Check the status of the Continuous Deployment
*********************************************

If you want to check the status of the continuous deployment after you have made the changes, use the following CLI command:

.. code-block:: bash

    node cli cd

Below is a sample output generated by the command:

.. figure:: ./cli-cd.png
   :alt: Output of node cli cd

   Output of node cli cd
