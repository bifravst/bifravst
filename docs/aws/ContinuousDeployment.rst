Continuous Deployment
================================================================================

\    **Note:** This is an optional step to keep the deployment in your
account in \    sync with the source code repository automatically.

For this to work you need to fork the source code in order to register
the webhook listener that trigger an update to your deployment.

After forking, make sure to update the [repository.url]{.title-ref} in
your forks [package.json]{.title-ref}.

This will set up a CodePipeline which triggers a CodeBuild project for
every push to the [saga]{.title-ref} branch. You can configure the
branch in the [deploy.branch]{.title-ref} property of the
[package.json]{.title-ref}. The CodeBuild project updates the
CloudFormation stack which contains the Bifravst resources.

A second CodePipeline will be set up for the web app which triggers a
CodeBuild project for every push to the [saga]{.title-ref} branch. You
can configure the repository URL and the branch for the web app in the
[deploy.webApp]{.title-ref} property of the [package.json]{.title-ref}.
The CodeBuild project updates the web app deployment on the S3 bucket.

Provide GitHub credentials
================================================================================

You need to create a \[developer
token\](<https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line>)
with [repo]{.title-ref}, [admin:repo_hook]{.title-ref} and
[read:packages]{.title-ref} permissions for an account that has write
permissions to your repository.

\    ðŸš¨ It is recommended to use a separate GitHub account for this, not
your \    personal GitHub account.

You need to store this token in AWS ParameterStore which is a
**one-time** manual step done through the AWS CLI:

    aws ssm put-parameter \--name /codebuild/github-token \--type String
    \--value \<Github Token\>

Enable Continuous Deployment
================================================================================

Now you can set up the continuous deployment:

    npx cdk deploy \'\*\' -c cd=1

Check the status of the Continuous Deployment
================================================================================

If you want to check the status of the Continuous Deployment after you
have made changes, you can use this CLI command:

    node cli cd
